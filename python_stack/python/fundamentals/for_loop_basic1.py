# Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.
# for x in range(151):
#     print(x)

# Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
# for x in range(5,1001):
#     print(x*5)

# Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If 
# divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible 
# by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
# for x in range(1,101):
#     if x%5==0:
#         print('Coding')
#     if x%10==0:
#         print('Coding Dojo')

# Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, 
# and print the final sum.
# sum = 0
# for x in range(0,500000):
#     sum = sum + x
#     x+1
# print(sum)

# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, 
# counting down by fours.
# for x in range(2018,0,-4):
#     print(x)

# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. 
# Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the 
# integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if 
# lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 
# (on successive lines)
# lowNum = 2
# highNum = 9
# mult = 3
# for x in range(lowNum, highNum):
#     x = x*mult
#     if x<=highNum:
#         print(x)
        
def a():
    print(5)
